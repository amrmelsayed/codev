# v1.5.3 Florence

Released: 2025-12-28

## Summary

Patch release with improved port conflict detection for remote access.

## Bug Fixes

- **Remote port detection**: Port availability check now uses `net.createServer()` instead of `fetch()`, which is more reliable for detecting ports in use but not serving HTTP. Fixes issue where `af start --remote` would fail with confusing error when local port was already in use.

## Technical Details

- Added `isPortAvailable()` function using `net.createServer()` for robust port checking
- Added unit tests for port availability detection
- Exported function for reuse in other parts of the codebase

## Migration Notes

None required. This is a backwards-compatible bug fix.
