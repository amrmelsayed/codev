# v1.4.0 Eichler

Released: 2025-12-15

## Summary

Eichler brings a major dashboard overhaul with a three-column layout, improved documentation, and a streamlined codebase. Named after Joseph Eichler, whose mid-century modern California homes represent accessible, thoughtful design.

## New Features

- **0057 - Dashboard Tab Overhaul**: Renamed "Projects" tab to "Dashboard" with a new three-column layout showing project status, open tabs, and file browser side-by-side. Replaces the welcome screen with actionable information.

- **0056 - Consult Types Refactor**: Moved review type prompts from `roles/review-types/` to `consult-types/` for better discoverability. Each review stage (spec-review, plan-review, impl-review, pr-ready, integration-review) has its own focused prompt file.

- **0047 - Tips & Tricks Page**: New `docs/tips.md` with practical tips for getting the most out of Codev and Agent Farm. Includes permission flags, resume commands, parallel consultations, and troubleshooting.

## Improvements

- **AI-Guided Release Process**: Tell the AI "Let's release v1.X.0" and it guides you through the entire RELEASE protocol - pre-flight checks, maintenance, tests, version bump, release notes, GitHub release, and npm publish.

- **Dynamic Version**: CLI now reads version from package.json at runtime instead of hardcoded value.

- **CLI Documentation**: Clarified that `codev`, `af`, and `consult` commands are designed for both humans and AI agents.

## Housekeeping

- Removed `codev eject` command (use `codev update` instead)
- Added .DS_Store and *.tgz to .gitignore
- Cleaned up skeleton resources (moved lessons-learned.md to templates/)
- Removed unused agent-farm/index.ts export

## Breaking Changes
