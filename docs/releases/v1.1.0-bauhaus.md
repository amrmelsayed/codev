# Codev v1.1.0 "Bauhaus"

**Release Date**: 2025-12-08

## Release Theme

Named after the Bauhaus school of design (1919-1933), which unified art and craft into a coherent system. This release unifies Codev's tools into a single, cohesive CLI package.

## Highlights

### Unified CLI Package (@cluesmith/codev)

The `codev` command is now a single npm package that includes all core tools:

```bash
npm install -g @cluesmith/codev
```

This provides three commands:
- **`codev`** - Project initialization and management
- **`af`** - Agent Farm for builder orchestration
- **`consult`** - Multi-model consultation tool

### New Codev Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `codev init` | Initialize a new project with Codev framework |
| `codev adopt` | Add Codev to an existing project |
| `codev doctor` | Diagnose installation and dependencies |
| `codev update` | Update Codev framework components |
| `codev tower` | Launch the Architect Tower dashboard |

### TICK as SPIDER Amendment (Spec 0040)

New workflow for amending existing specs without creating new numbered documents:
- Amendments are tracked in-place within the original spec
- TICKs reference their parent spec (e.g., TICK-001 for spec 0022)
- Lighter-weight process for evolutionary changes

### Architect-Mediated PR Reviews (TICK-001)

Improved consultation workflow for PR reviews:
- Architect prepares comprehensive PR overview
- Consultants analyze provided context (no filesystem exploration)
- Review time reduced from ~200s to <60s per consultant
- New `--context` flag for the consult tool

## Breaking Changes

None. This release is backward compatible with v1.0.0.

## Upgrade Path

```bash
# If installed globally
npm update -g @cluesmith/codev
