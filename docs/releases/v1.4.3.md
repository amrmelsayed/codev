# v1.4.3

Released: 2025-12-17

## Summary

Bug fix release addressing port allocation conflicts on macOS and test infrastructure updates for the modular dashboard.

## Bug Fixes

- **Port 5000 Blocklist**: Port 5000 is now blocklisted for allocation since macOS uses it for AirPlay Receiver (ControlCenter). Projects will automatically skip to port 5100.

- **Port Gap Recycling**: Port allocation now recycles gaps. If you delete a project at port 4400, the next new project will reuse that port instead of always taking the next highest.

- **Clipboard Test Paths**: Fixed test file paths after dashboard modularization (Spec 0060).

- **E2E Dashboard Tests**: Updated tests to use the modular dashboard structure (`templates/dashboard/`) instead of the deleted `dashboard-split.html`.

## Breaking Changes

None

## Migration Notes

None required. The port blocklist and gap recycling are automatic.
